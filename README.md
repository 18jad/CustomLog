Nothing at all, literally 0 use cases, made this cause im bored

Use ```CustomLog.setCustom(property, value)``` to set custom style. Note: properties and values are both css code

Use ```log(msg)``` to log out stuff in console

Use ```CustomLog.reset()``` to reset the style

Special: 
  Use ```CustomLog.specialCustom(type)``` to add special styles:
  - Currently only ```type = "rainbow"``` is available. Note: it will change all logs code after it and can't be reseted.
